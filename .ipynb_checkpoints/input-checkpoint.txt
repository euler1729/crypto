Write a program in Python that implements the Vigenere polyalphabetic cipher for English
text. Your cipher should distinguish lowercase and uppercase letters (i.e. a letter should be
encrypted differently based on if it is uppercase or lowercase). In your cipher, the
encryption key, plaintext and the ciphertext should be composed of lowercase and
uppercase letters. Your program should read the input from a file called ‘input.txt’ and write
to a file called ‘output.txt’. It should read the encryption key from a file called ‘key.txt’. Your
program should perform the following operations:

(a) Remove unnecessary characters except A - Z, a - z from the English text in
‘input.txt’.

(b) Encode the message using the keyphrase in ‘key.txt’.
(c) Convert the ciphertext produced in step (b) into a message consisting of words with 5
characters and write it into ‘output.txt’.
(d) Decode the ciphertext in ‘output.txt’ into the original message.
